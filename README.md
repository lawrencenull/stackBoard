# stackBoard
Stackboard is a realtime collaboration board that uses websockets, HTML5 canvas and the Filepicker API.

Users can add/edit sticky notes, upload photos, and draw freehand on the app. Sticky notes and photos are draggable. 

When multiple users visit the app they can see each other's updates in realtime.
